# Saga Choreography Microservices

The Saga architecture pattern provides transaction management using a sequence of local transactions.

In the Saga Choreography pattern, each microservice that is part of the transaction publishes an event that is processed by the next microservice. There is not any coordinator/controller between services and each services communicate with others to complete the transaction using messaging bus or broker. A choreography saga pattern is a method to organise sagas where participants swap events without a centralized control point.
